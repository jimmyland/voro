## Cellular 3D Modeling using Voronoi Diagrams

Built on top of threejs and voro++ (used in js via emscripten), this is a simple 3D modeling program that lets you make shapes out of voronoi cells.  Try it out on the live github pages page ( http://jimmyland.github.io/voro-experiment/ ), and click the HELP? link there for more practical usage advice.

Any new code here from me is released under the standard open source MIT license.
